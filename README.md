# Particle selector with machine learning

## Data selection tools based on machine learning for hyperon form factor studies with the Belle II experiment.

The purpose of my master thesis is to develop an event selection toolkit for the study of the hyperon form factor at the energy of Belle II.
The work has been developed using a machine learning approach. 

My work of thesis has been conducted in Uppsala University for an Erasmus Plus Traineeship program. The activity started on September 2023 until March 2024.
In this period I had the occasion to study and work together with the hadron physics group of Uppsala. 

At the beginning of the thesis I give a brief introduction on the Standard Model of particle physics, and in particular on the Λ hyperon. In Chapter 3
I introduce the *Belle II experiment*, describing the components of the entire detector. Since a great part of my thesis consists of the development of a
machine learning tool for the Λ hyperon selection I explain in Chapter 4 how machine learning works, while Chapter 5 defines the strategy and 
the analysis plan for the study. My analysis starts from Chapter 6, presenting the Monte Carlo samples I generated and used during the activity. The analysis
of the performance of the reconstruction of the γISR is described in Chapter 7, while Chapter 8 is completely dedicated on the reconstruction of the
Λ hyperons in the Belle II experiment, first presenting a classical approach, i.e. studying the single kinematics variables distributions, and 
then presenting the machine learning approach comparing the different configurations I evaluated during the analysis. Finally, at the last Chapter, the results of my
thesis are summarized and compared to previous analysis.
