# particle selector with machine learning

The purpose of my master thesis is to develop an event selection toolkit for the study of the hyperon form factor in the Belle II experiment.
The work has been developed using a machine learning approach. From Chapter 8 you can see how I conducted the machine learning analysis for the event selection starting from a generic (background+ signal) Monte Carlo sample.
